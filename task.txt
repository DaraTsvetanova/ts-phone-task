Define a class that holds information about a mobile 
phone device: model, manufacturer, price, 
owner, battery characteristics (model, hours idle and 
hours talk) and display characteristics 
(size and number of colors). Define 3 separate 
classes 
(class Phone holding instances of the classes 
Battery and Display).

Assume that model and manufacturer are mandatory 
(the others are optional).

Add an enumeration BatteryType (Li-Ion, NiMH, NiCd, â€¦) and use it as a new field for the batteries.

Add a method in the Phone class for displaying all 
information about it.

Create a class Call to hold a call performed through 
a Phone. It should contain date, time, 
dialed phone number and duration (in seconds).

Add a property CallHistory in the Phone class to 
hold a list of the performed calls.

Add methods in the Phone class for adding and 
deleting calls from the calls history. Add a 
method to clear the call history.

Add a method that calculates the total price of 
the calls in the call history. Assume the price per 
minute is fixed and is provided as a parameter.
